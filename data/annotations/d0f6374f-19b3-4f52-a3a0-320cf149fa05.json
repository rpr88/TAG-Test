The vote was 104 to five, with 19 abstentions. The opposing votes were cast by the United States, Britain, France, Portugal, and South Africa. The vote showed that the great majority of the world's countries were not persuaded by US propaganda that Puerto Rico is a free-associated state, an independent country whose people voluntarily choose to live under US hegemony. "}]}],"tags":[],"uuid":"8fa644c7-9d36-4385-b1bf-9e4cbd8f9c9a"},{"start_time":1350,"end_time":1397,"annotation":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Ricardo Alarcón, Cuban ambassador to the United Nations, played a leading role in support of the resolution during the more than three months of diplomatic struggle within the world body prior to the final vote.

Although Mexico, which produces the greater part of its own oil, is better placed than many countries to cope with the world energy crisis, it is not immune from its effects. Indeed, the government had been forced to eat the words of the director of the state oil concerned PEMEX, Antonio Dovalí Jaime, who last month declared that the world oil shortage would not affect Mexico or bring an increase in its domestic price. At the end of last week, not only was just such a price increase decreed, the first since 1958, with rises right across the board of 60 to 80% for all oil products, but President Luis Echeverría Alvarez convened an unprecedented public conference to discuss the crisis as it affects Mexico. "}]}],"tags":[],"uuid":"28a10f03-663d-4b29-9c03-79b62017c035"},{"start_time":1508,"end_time":1544,"annotation":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"This conference, chaired by the president himself, brought together the members of the cabinet, directors of state companies, the diplomatic corps and the press, and was televised live throughout Mexico.
